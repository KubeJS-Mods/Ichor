# About

Ichor is a WIP language interpreter for Java that supports JavaScript, TypeScript and other languages in the future, made from scratch by some guy who was just really bored.

It's loosely based on concepts of [Crafting Interpreters' JLox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) and [Mozilla's Rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino).

# Supported Languages

### JavaScript

Fully supported ES5 (as far as I'm aware), partially supported ES6.

### TypeScript

Not counting JavaScript support, only partial support for types and TS keywords.

# Running code

No example yet! But you can take a look at the [test package](/src/test/java/dev/latvian/apps/ichor/test).
